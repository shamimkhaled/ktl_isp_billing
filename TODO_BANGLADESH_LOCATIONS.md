## Implementation Summary

### What's Been Implemented:

1. **Location Models**: 
   - `District` model with name, Bengali name, code, and active status
   - `Thana` model with relationship to districts
   - Proper indexing and constraints

2. **User Model Enhancements**:
   - Changed district/thana from CharField to ForeignKey
   - Added token management for lifetime login
   - Added validation methods

3. **API Layer**:
   - Complete serializers for locations
   - RESTful API endpoints with filtering
   - Proper error handling and validation

4. **Data Management**:
   - Management command with all 64 Bangladesh districts
   - Over 500 thanas/upazilas with proper district relationships
   - Easy data population and clearing

5. **Admin Interface**:
   - Proper admin registration
   - Search and filtering capabilities

### Key Features:

1. **Automatic Location Selection**: Users can select districts and thanas from predefined lists
2. **Cascading Selection**: Thanas are filtered based on selected district
3. **Validation**: Ensures thana belongs to selected district
4. **Comprehensive Data**: All Bangladesh administrative divisions included
5. **Token Management**: Support for lifetime login with access/refresh tokens
6. **API Documentation**: Proper API endpoints with filtering and search

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Get all districts
GET /api/v1/locations/districts/

# Get thanas for a specific district
GET /api/v1/locations/thanas/?district={district_id}

# Get thanas for Dhaka district specifically
GET /api/v1/locations/districts/{dhaka_district_id}/thanas/

# Create user with district and thana
POST /api/v1/users/
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "login_id": "john.doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "district": "district_uuid",
    "thana": "thana_uuid",
    ...
}
```

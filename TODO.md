# TODO: Docker Configuration Updates and Role-Based Permissions

## Docker Configuration Updates (Completed)
- [x] Create `nginx.conf` for production web server configuration
- [x] Add Celery and Celery Beat services to `docker-compose.yml`
- [x] Create comprehensive `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- [x] Update `docker-compose.prod.yml` with complete environment variables and optimized settings
- [x] Enhance `Dockerfile` with additional tools, health checks, and better practices
- [x] Improve `entrypoint.sh` with better service waiting, Redis support, and error handling
- [x] Create `docker-compose.override.yml` for local development overrides
- [x] Update `README_DOCKER.md` with comprehensive setup instructions
- [x] Create `.dockerignore` for optimized Docker builds
- [x] Fix Docker volume naming conflicts and ContainerConfig errors
- [x] Simplify Docker Compose configuration for better compatibility
- [x] Verify Docker services are running correctly

## Role-Based Permissions for Users App API (Completed)
- [x] Create custom permission class `IsSuperAdminOrAdmin` in `apps/users/permissions.py`
- [x] Update `UserListCreateView` to use different permissions for GET vs POST
- [x] Update `UserDetailView` to use different permissions for GET vs write operations
- [x] Import permission class in `apps/users/views.py`

## Docker Configuration Summary
**docker-compose.yml (Development):**
- PostgreSQL 15 database with health checks
- Redis 7-alpine for caching and Celery
- Django web service with Gunicorn
- Celery worker and beat services
- Proper service dependencies and volumes

**docker-compose.prod.yml (Production):**
- Production settings with optimized Gunicorn configuration
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL support
- Complete environment variable configuration
- Production-grade Celery settings

**Dockerfile Improvements:**
- Added health checks
- Better security with non-root user
- Additional debugging tools (curl, vim, htop)
- Optimized Python package installation

**nginx.conf:**
- Static and media file serving
- Security headers
- WebSocket support
- Health check endpoint

## Permission Rules Implemented
- **GET /api/users/** (List users): All authenticated users
- **POST /api/users/** (Create user): Only super_admin and admin
- **GET /api/users/{id}/** (Retrieve user): All authenticated users
- **PUT /api/users/{id}/** (Update user): Only super_admin and admin
- **PATCH /api/users/{id}/** (Partial update user): Only super_admin and admin
- **DELETE /api/users/{id}/** (Delete user): Only super_admin and admin

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the Docker setup with `docker-compose up`
- [ ] Test the API endpoints to ensure permissions work correctly
- [ ] Verify production deployment with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`
- [ ] Consider adding monitoring and logging services
